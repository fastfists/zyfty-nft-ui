              An NFT owner can elect to redeem their NFT at any point with
              Zyfty. This will cause the NFT to be destroyed. See white paper
              and for details.

              Most likely, yes. However, much like the traditional sales
              process, the extent to which viewings will be offered is up to the
              seller of the NFT.

              Is there an escrow process upon an offer being accepted to
              purchase an NFT?

              Yes, there is an escrow process that is very similar to the
              current marketplace. Upon an offer, or bid for the home, a small
              amount of currency will be held in escrow as a “soft” deposit.
              Upon acceptance of an offer by the seller, an additional amount
              will be added to the “soft” deposit along with a “hard” deposit
              later in the escrow period. Like all real estate transactions, the
              length of the escrow period as well as “soft” and “hard” deposit
              amounts vary based on the NFT seller’s purchasing criteria.

              In addition to the information noted in the NFT home listing on
              the Zyfty Marketplace, potential NFT buyers may purchase a
              “manifest” which includes all documents necessary to perform due
              diligence on the property represented by the NFT.
