            Traditional real estate sales involve many parties including title,
            escrow, brokerage, governmental agencies and others. The Zyfty
            solution involves the seller, the buyer and their crypto wallets.
            Itâ€™s that simple.

          <h3 class="content-title">Process</h3>
          <p>
            Zyfty acquires residential properties and then creates NFTs
            representing long term leases of up to 99 years. These NFTs may be
            held by the NFT owner, sold on Zyfty or any compatible NFT
            marketplace, or transferred via a direct person to person
            transaction.

          <h3 class="content-title">Private, Fast, Liquid</h3>
          <p>
            Zyfty NFTs provide privacy, as any public record search yields Zyfty
            as both the title holder and the lessee.
          </p>
          <p>
            Zyfty NFTs can transfer instantaneously with a transaction cost as
            little as 0.5%.
          </p>
          <p>
            Zyfty NFTs have transparent, detailed listing information. This
            allows fast, easy diligence and quick sales, along with exposure to
            the DeFi ecosystem.
